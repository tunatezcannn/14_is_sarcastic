#14-NLP MODEL FOR PREDICTING SARCASM
I used kaggle news headlines for sarcasm dataset for making predictions if it is a sarcastic or not.
I used 4 simple ready model which belongs to scikit-learn and I get 
# %95.25 accuracy on logisticregression model
# %82.50 accuracy on multinomial naive model
# %96.25 accuracy on randomforestclassifier model
# %95.75 accuracy on svm model 
I need to tell.I used very small percent of data. Only have 2000 samples because of getting articles with python beautiful soup library is taking too long. If you use all of 60k samples in dataset the results maybe different
